1. Use switchwindowhandle if locator not present in pagesource

2. Look for/ask the devs for HelpText property if state of any icon needed for e.g. mic state on meetingPreparatoryScreen

3. Use mouseKeyboardInteraction entity if facing any issues while sendkeys or interacting with the elements

4. Not able to use chaining of xpaths on Participant screen/ breakout room screen
If similiar issue happens then need to write complete xpath and replace dynamic value

5. If getText property is not giving the desired text look for getAttribute("Name")

6. Always use sendkeys option for ComboBox element as it appears as drop-down list 
For e.g -> Event category in plan an event popup

7. If waitTillElementIsPresent or waitTillElementIsVisible is not waiting for 10 seconds then add Wait.waifor while waiting for such element

8. If script is waiting for the element and element is also present in Pagesource then call
driver.getInnerDriver.getPageSource() 
just before waiting for that element

9. If more than one element is present for unique accessibility id/ name or any other property in the Pagesource and on the ui only one element is shown then use property
IsOffscreen= false 

10. If any element is disappearing in 3-5 seconds on windows then skip that element validation as it is intermittent to catch for the script
For e.g. clicking on copy button shows text Copied -> then text "Copied" is intermittent to catch
In such cases we mark the test case as partially automated
